This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

# Part 1

This is a unordered list:  
- list item one  
- list item two  
- list item three  


```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.height=10, fig.width=10}
plot(cars)
```


```{bash, eval=FALSE}
#bedtools
cd path
samtool -input someinput.tex -cpu 10
```

Using the above setting, I will get my results in about 1 hours.



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
